# Embed Lib

This package wraps up some functionality for producing embeddings. The initial version wrangles all of the E5-specific tokenization and inference logic and provides a batched-iteration interface for embedding large sequences of input text in a single Python function call.

This library also pins its dependencies, which might be helpful for keeping organized.
